🚀 The Quick Lowdown

I’m a developer based in Boulder, CO, obsessed with the intersection of high-scale software and low-level hardware. Whether I'm optimizing edge functions on Cloudflare or rewiring the dash of my '91 Suburban, I'm always building.

🛠️ Current Focus: Scaling OpenShop, a PaaS for instant e-commerce deployment.

🧠 R&D: Experimenting with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for HFT strategies.

🏎️ Garage Projects: Building a custom NUC-based headunit for my Suburban, focusing on custom power management and Linux-based infotainment.
